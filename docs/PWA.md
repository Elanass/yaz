# PWA Implementation for Decision Precision in Surgery

This document describes the Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation for the Decision Precision in Surgery platform.

## Overview

The platform has been enhanced with PWA capabilities to provide:

- Offline functionality for critical decision support
- Installability on any device (desktop, mobile, tablet, IoT)
- Responsive design adaptations for different devices
- Service worker for background operations and caching
- Native-like experience with fast loading times

## Key PWA Components

### 1. Web App Manifest

The manifest file (`/static/manifest.json`) enables:

- Installation on home screen
- Full-screen mode without browser UI
- Splash screen on startup
- Appropriate icons for different devices and scenarios

### 2. Service Worker

The service worker (`/static/sw.js`) provides:

- Offline functionality by caching critical assets
- Background sync for data when connectivity is restored
- Intelligent caching strategies:
  - Network-first for API calls (with fallback to cache)
  - Cache-first for static assets
  - Offline fallback page when truly offline

### 3. Responsive Design Enhancements

The platform uses adaptive design patterns:

- Device-specific layouts via media queries
- Input method adaptations (touch vs. mouse vs. remote)
- Accessibility enhancements
- Reduced motion and distraction for in-vehicle use
- Print-optimized styles for clinical reports

### 4. Cross-Device Support

The platform is optimized for multiple contexts:

- Desktop browsers
- Tablets and iPads
- Mobile phones
- Kiosk/information displays
- In-vehicle displays

## Testing PWA Features

1. **Lighthouse Audit**: Run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to verify PWA score
2. **Offline Testing**: Toggle "Offline" in Chrome DevTools Network panel
3. **Installation**: Look for install prompt or use "Install" option in browser menu
4. **Cross-Device**: Test on actual devices or using device emulation in DevTools

## Future PWA Enhancements

- Background notifications for critical clinical alerts
- File system access for improved document handling
- Advanced caching strategies for large datasets
- WebAssembly for compute-intensive operations
- Web Bluetooth for medical device integration
