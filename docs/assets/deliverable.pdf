# Sample PDF Report - Gastric Surgery Cohort Analysis

**Generated:** 2025-08-08 14:30:25  
**Cases Analyzed:** 10  
**Domain:** Surgery/Gastric Oncology

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes a cohort of 10 gastric surgery cases with comprehensive survival metrics and protocol compliance assessment.

## Key Findings

### Survival Metrics
- **Median Survival:** 845 days (27.8 months)
- **1-Year Survival Rate:** 82% (8/10 patients)
- **2-Year Survival Rate:** 67% (6/9 eligible patients)

### TNM Staging Distribution
- T1-T2 (Early Stage): 40% (4 cases)
- T3-T4 (Advanced Stage): 60% (6 cases)
- N0 (No Nodal Involvement): 30% (3 cases)
- N1-N3 (Nodal Involvement): 70% (7 cases)

### Procedure Types
- Total Gastrectomy: 60% (6 cases)
- Subtotal Gastrectomy: 40% (4 cases)

## Clinical Recommendations

### Protocol Adherence
✅ **Strong Compliance:** TNM staging documented for all cases  
✅ **Good Practice:** R0 resection achieved in 90% of cases  
⚠️ **Monitor:** Lymph node yield averaging 15 nodes (target: >15)

### Treatment Optimization
1. **FLOT Integration:** Consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy for T3+ cases
2. **Extended Lymphadenectomy:** Maintain D2 dissection standards
3. **Multidisciplinary Review:** Weekly MDT review for complex cases

### Quality Indicators
- **30-Day Mortality:** 0% (0/10 cases)
- **Major Complications:** 10% (1/10 cases)
- **Readmission Rate:** 10% (1/10 cases)

## Statistical Analysis

### Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves
[Survival curve would be embedded here in actual PDF]

**Log-rank Test Results:**
- Early vs Advanced Stage: p = 0.045 (significant)
- Node Negative vs Positive: p = 0.038 (significant)

### Risk Stratification
**High Risk Factors:**
- T3/T4 staging (HR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1-4.8)
- N2/N3 nodal involvement (HR: 1.9, 95% CI: 0.9-4.1)
- Age >70 years (HR: 1.6, 95% CI: 0.8-3.2)

## Action Items

### Immediate (Next 30 Days)
- [ ] Review lymph node yield protocols
- [ ] Implement FLOT eligibility screening
- [ ] Update surgical technique documentation

### Short-term (Next 90 Days)
- [ ] Establish formal MDT process
- [ ] Create patient education materials
- [ ] Develop quality metrics dashboard

### Long-term (Next 6 Months)
- [ ] Expand cohort to 50+ cases
- [ ] Implement enhanced recovery protocols
- [ ] Consider participation in clinical trials

## Data Quality Assessment

### Completeness
- TNM Staging: 100% complete
- Survival Data: 90% complete (1 case lost to follow-up)
- Pathology Reports: 100% available

### Accuracy
- Cross-validated with pathology database
- Survival status confirmed through registry linkage
- Staging reviewed by two independent clinicians
